# Streaming-services-with-a-user-centric-approach-using-DRL

## abstract
- In this study, we propose a novel method to dynamically adjust bandwidth, power, and quality while considering the user’s residual data availability in a video streaming environment utilizing cellular data.
- The method is designed to ensure the best video quality without exceeding the user’s data usage limit through deep reinforcement learning.
